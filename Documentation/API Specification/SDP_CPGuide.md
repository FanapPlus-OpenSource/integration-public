You can create users in SDP and share the credentials with them for log-in.

![Menu-ReportingDashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48704567-2d629c00-ec0c-11e8-9547-2801ef4a144a.jpg)


![Menu-ReportingDashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48759001-12009b00-ecb7-11e8-86bc-d2e0a180dee0.jpg)

## Bulk Management
One of the main features of SDP is Bulk / Campaign Management. In this section, users are able to create user segments, choose tags, schedule times to send bulk messages to them and more.

### User Segmentation
The first step in sending bulk messages to users is to create a __User Segment__. 


![Menu-ReportingDashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48704569-2d629c00-ec0c-11e8-9dcd-63718ab70d41.jpg)

A User Segment can either be created by using *Account IDs* or *User Phone Numbers*. Account ID is a hashed string which uniquely identifies each user who signs in using Fanap Plus Identity. Another way of acquiring Account IDs is to receive it in *Messaging* requests. After choosing the user type, a name should be assigned to the segment and lastly a CSV file containing user information (phone number / Account ID) should be uploaded by the user. There is also a sample user information file ready to be downloaded which contains sample phone numbers or AccounIDs and shows the right format of the file to be uploaded.

![Menu-ReportingDashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48760108-4cb80280-ecba-11e8-84ee-faddc84df08c.jpg)
After creating the segment, by clicking on the eye icon, the user can view the segment information and add custom tags to the segment. The tags will be stored for each message sent to end-users.

### Bulk Request
The second step in Bulk Management is to schedule for a bulk to be sent to a specific segment. Note that the bulk will only be sent if the administrator approves it.

## Service Management

In order to map Mobile Network Operator services to their owners, a.k.a CPs, __Service Management__ should take place. You can view your AppID and Services in this section in the form of a list.
Note that an AppID is a hashed string which uniquely identifies each application. The owner of the AppID is previously identified by Fanap Plus Identity using their TenantID and Each Tenant can have infinite number of applications.â€‹

## Product Management

When services are created and approved by the administrator, the user can create various products connected to their services.
