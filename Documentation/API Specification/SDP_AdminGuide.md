## Introduction

Fanap Plus Service Delivery Platform is platform that presents service delivery architecture to businesses who are utilizing telecommunication services, connecting them to Mobile Network Operators. However this explanation is specific to Fanap Plus and there is no standard definition of SDP in industry and different players define its characteristics in different ways. Yet the main feature of SDP is that it requires a complete integration of IT capabilities and the creation of services that cross technology and network boundaries. 
Fanap Plus is offering telecommunications services such as Messaging services as well as non-telecommunication ones such as Score & Credit Calculations, Authentication and Reporting services.
The purpose of this platform is to enable rapid development and deployment of all services.


## Login
 Use [this link](https://sdp.fanap.plus/account/login) to login to Fanap Plus SDP by using administrator credentials.
 At the top of this page, you can choose which Content Provider Account you would want to log in with. Since the SDP Administrator does not belong to a specific CP Account, this field should be left __blank__ while using the SDP administrator account.
You can check the "Remember Me" checkbox so that the next time you visit the website, the browser automatically fills up the password field for you.

In the bottom part of the page, where the reports will be visible, there are different __Report Type__ tabs to select. The selected __Report Type__ by default is of *Subscription* type, however other types of reports such as *Revocation*, *Income* and *Messages* can be also selected by switching between tabs.

## Content Providers
The system administrator can create accounts for each Content Provider and share the credentials with them for log-in.

## Users
The system administrator can create users in SDP accounts for each Content Provider and share the credentials with them for log-in. In addition while creating each user, the system administrator should select which roles to assign to that user.

<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48759006-13ca5e80-ecb7-11e8-820e-ed3c3f1221e3.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 13 : User Creation - Roles</figcaption></figure><br>

## Bulk Management
One of the main features of SDP is Bulk / Campaign Management. In this section, users are able to create user segments, choose tags, schedule times to send bulk messages to them and more.

### User Segmentation
The first step in sending bulk messages to users is to create a __User Segment__. 

<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48704569-2d629c00-ec0c-11e8-9dcd-63718ab70d41.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 14 : Bulk Management - User Segmentation</figcaption></figure><br>

A User Segment can either be created by using *Account IDs* or *User Phone Numbers*. Account ID is a hashed string which uniquely identifies each user who signs in using Fanap Plus Identity. Another way of acquiring Account IDs is to receive it in *Messaging* requests. After choosing the user type, a name should be assigned to the segment and lastly a CSV file containing user information (phone number / Account ID) should be uploaded by the user. There is also a sample user information file ready to be downloaded which contains sample phone numbers or AccounIDs and shows the right format of the file to be uploaded.
<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48760108-4cb80280-ecba-11e8-84ee-faddc84df08c.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 15 : Bulk Management - Segment Creation</figcaption></figure><br>
After creating the segment, by clicking on the eye icon, the user can view the segment information and add custom tags to the segment. The tags will be stored for each message sent to end-users.
<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48764181-357e1280-ecc4-11e8-80b1-18cc31cb0891.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 16 : Bulk Management - Adding Tags</figcaption></figure><br>

### Bulk Request
The second step in Bulk Management is to schedule for a bulk to be sent to a specific segment. Note that the bulk will only be sent if the administrator approves it.
<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48704568-2d629c00-ec0c-11e8-9bc4-faf7934bf89d.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 17 : Bulk Management - Bulk Requests</figcaption></figure><br>
<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48764944-4fb8f000-ecc6-11e8-83fe-e06be3168093.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 18 : Bulk Management - Scheduling Bulk</figcaption></figure><br>

## Service Management
<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48704577-2e93c900-ec0c-11e8-87df-9c0d42b74919.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 19 : Service Management</figcaption></figure><br>
In order to map Mobile Network Operator services to their owners, a.k.a CPs, __Service Management__ should take place. Therefore to create a service first you should choose a CP. The next step would be to create an AppID for that CP. An AppID is a hashed string which uniquely identifies each application. The owner of the AppID is previously identified by Fanap Plus Identity using their TenantID and Each Tenant can have infinite number of applications.â€‹
<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48765841-534d7680-ecc8-11e8-8ae0-264f1512894b.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 20 : Service Management - Adding AppID</figcaption></figure><br>
After creating the AppID, a service can be created as its subset. Service Name, its platform type, Operator SID, and Ghasedak SID should be defined. After the service is created, its status should be approved by the administrator so that it can be used in other parts of the SDP.
 <figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48766375-90fecf00-ecc9-11e8-86d7-b0c661e6ac68.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 21 : Service Management - Adding Service</figcaption></figure><br>
 
## Product Management

When services are created and approved by the administrator, the user can create various products connected to their services.
<figure><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32090767/48704575-2dfb3280-ec0c-11e8-9a0c-ebe588fcab9d.jpg'><figcaption><i>Figure 22 : Product Management</figcaption></figure><br>

On the main page of __Product Management__ a list of existing products is available. Note that the list has a default filter and it only displays the active products, however this filter can be removed if necessary.
As the administrator, when creating a product, the first step should be to choose the Content Provider. Next, one of the available templates should be chosen:
